My goal was to list the articles that were in the top, and show the article name and links. I started by seeing what websire I wanted to search and scraping what I was looking for. I wanted to see if people wanted to see the list again, and I put in user inputs for their answer. I tried doing other stuff but I couldn't get them to work,so I took those out.
